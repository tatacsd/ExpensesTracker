## Introduction
This project is part of the React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) course on Udemy, created by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/#instructor-2).

The app is a simple app to track expenses, and it is a good example of how to use React and Redux. 
In this project we have a single page app, where the user can add expenses, and see a list of expenses, filter by year, and a chart of the expenses in the year.

Through the construction of this app, we have learned:
- How to create a component in React
- How to create and use a JSX syntax
- How to output dynamic data using JSX
- How to pass data using props
- How to use react state
- How to use the useState hook
- How to forms in React
- How to handle a user input in a form
- How to work with multiple inputs in a form
- How to handle a form submission
- How to update an state in a form
- Component communication (#58.Bottom-up)
- Understanding the Key on a component
- How to add dinamic style to a compononent using inline styles
